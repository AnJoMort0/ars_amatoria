[Initial setting]
The Exam Room is a room. "[if unvisited]I stumble one more time out of the final exam, the weight of textbooks finally off my shoulders. There she is, standing in the corridor, the girl I've barely spoken to all semester, if I can even say that now, but I can't get her out of my mind. She's laughing. My heart races; this is my chance, maybe my last chance, once again... one more time...[paragraph break][end if] The room is chaotic as students rush out, relieved that the ordeal is over. I catch glimpses of stressed faces and hear a mix of sighs and chatter. A sea of people flows towards the corridor."
The Corridor is a room. Outside from the Exam Room is the Corridor.
The Toilet is a room. Inside from the Corridor is the Toilet.
The Front of the School is a room. Outside of the Corridor is The Front of the School.

		Jackson comes from behind me, friendly punches me in the shoulder and happily asks:[line break]
		'So how was it?'[paragraph break]
		Still surprised I answer:[line break]
		'It was alright.'[paragraph break]
		As I look back at the corridor, the girl is not there anymore. I've lost my chance...";
